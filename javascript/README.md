# Purchase Order & Invoice Management System

This project is a **JavaScript-based Purchase Order (PO) and Invoice Management System** designed for a corporate training organization.  
It simulates how POs are created when a training is confirmed and how invoices are generated after training completion, including due-date tracking and overdue alerts.
